# This is a series of code solutions for exercises from the textbook
# "A Primer on Scientific Computing with Python" by Hans Petter Langtangen
# that I worked through in 2015. Exercise files have the general label
# "exercise_X_Y.py" where X is the chapter and Y is the exercise number.
#
#
# Furthermore the project includes a lot of example code from the book itself
# along with example files (text, images) generated as program output.
